        <!--applies the JS to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML. 
        The <script> element is placed near the bottom of the HTML file, because the browser 
        reads code in the order it appears in the file. If the JS loads first and it is supposed
        to affect the HTML that has not loaded yet, there could be problems.-->
